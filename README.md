# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Neural-Networks-and-Explainability-N-BEATS-
End-to-end pipeline that generates complex synthetic time-series data, trains a simplified N-BEATS model for multi-step forecasting, compares it with an STL+ARIMA baseline, and provides decomposition-based explainability outputs with all scripts and analysis included.
